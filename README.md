## Project Description

ERS Refactor Project. Refactor an existing application to implement Servlets API with Tomcat Runtime and refactor JDBC for a Hibernate implementation.

## Technologies Used

* Tomcat
* Java
* Dbeaver
* Hibernate
* JDBC
* PostgreSQL
* AWS EC2
* AWS RDS

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* A user can accept or reject reimbursements.
* Uses JPA Hibernate for object modeling to PostgreSQL.
* Implemented user-defined servlets using Servlets API with Tomcat, exposing resources through endpoints with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE verbs.

To-do list:
* Implement front controller design pattern for Servlets
* Implement connection pooling

## Getting Started
   
git clone https://github.com/Jl3E/project1point5.git
connect to Tomcat and configure to your database


## Usage

By using our endpoints such as:
/user which will show you all of these:
/user/delete

/user/getById

/user/getByUserId

/user/getList

/user/insert

Similarly by hitting the endpoint /reimbursement you have the same funcitonality as above.
